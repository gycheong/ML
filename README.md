## Machine Learning Algorithms (Theory & Practice)

This repository summarizes various Machine Learning (ML) algorithms with mathematical explanations as well as examples for implementations. All materials are written by me, and they will expand over time. Currently, any citations are given in terms of hyperlinks within the contents.


### Linear and Polynomial Regressions (folder)
* **Linear Regression (theory).ipynb** contains mathematical explanations on how linear regression algorithm works.
* **Polynomial Regression (theory).ipynb** contains mathematical explanations on how polynomial regression algorithm works.
* **Linear and Polynomial Regressions (practice).ipynb** explains how to use linear regression and polynomial regression in practice by finding linear and polynomial models that predict the weekly sales of Walmart based on store, air tempreture, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment rate. We use [dataset about Walmart sales from Kaggle by mikhail1681](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mikhail1681/walmart-sales?select=Walmart_sales.csv).

### PCA (folder)
* **PCA (theory).ipynb** contains mathematical explanations on how principal component analysis (PCA) works. It also breifly explains ideas behind dimenaionality reduction and [principal component regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_regression).

### SVM (folder)
* **SVM (theory).ipynb** contains mathematical explanations on how support vector machine (SVM) algorithm works. It also breifly expalins the role of the radial basis function (RBF) kernel.
* **SVM (practice).ipynb** explains how to use SVM model in practice by finding SVM models that predict obesity based on several factors not are weight nor height; these are age, family history with overweight, high calroric food consumption, and food between meals. We use a [dataset for estimation of obesity levels based on eating habits and physical condition in individuals from Colombia, Peru and Mexico in UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition).
