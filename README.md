## Machine Learning Algorithms (Theory & Practice)

This repository summarizes various Machine Learning (ML) algorithms with mathematical explanations as well as examples for implementations. All materials are written by me, and they will expand over time. Currently, any citations are given in terms of hyperlinks within the contents.

* **Linear Regression (theory).ipynb** contains mathematical explanations on how linear regression works.
* **Polynomial Regression (theory).ipynb** contains mathematical explanations on how polynomial regression works.
* **Linear and Polynomial Regressions (practice).ipynb** explains how to use linear regression and polynomial regression in practice by applying to find a model that predicts the weekly sales of Walmart based on store, air tempreture, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment rate. For this demonstration, we use [dataset about Walmart sales from Kaggle by mikhail1681](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mikhail1681/walmart-sales?select=Walmart_sales.csv).
