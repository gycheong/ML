## Machine Learning Algorithms (Theory & Practice)

This repository summarizes various Machine Learning (ML) algorithms with mathematical explanations as well as examples for implementations. All materials are written by me, and they will expand over time. Currently, any citations are given in terms of hyperlinks within the contents.

* **Linear Regression (theory).ipynb** contains mathematical explanations on how linear regression works.
* **Polynomial Regression (theory).ipynb** contains mathematical explanations on how polynomial regression works.
